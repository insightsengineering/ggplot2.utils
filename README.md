The `ggplot2.utils` package simplifies access to utility functions
adding functionality to [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). The
package imports functions across multiple extensions packages and then
exports them, so that the user only needs to load this package instead
of multiple others. In addition, this package provides layers for
Kaplan-Meier lines and ticks additions to plots.  
All functions are tested to make sure that they work reliably.
