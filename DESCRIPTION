Description: Selected utilities, in particular 'geoms' and 'stats' functions, 
    extending the 'ggplot2' package. Note that this package does not define 
    the functions itself, but instead imports them from a collection of other 
    packages and then exports them. These functions are tested as well to make 
    sure that they work reliably.
