Description: Selected utilities, in particular 'geoms' and 'stats'
    functions, extending the 'ggplot2' package. Note that this package
    does not define the functions itself, but instead imports them from a
    collection of other packages and then exports them. These functions
    are tested as well to make sure that they work reliably. Currently,
    the selected functions are from 'EnvStats'
    <doi:10.1007/978-1-4614-8456-1>, 'GGally' <doi:10.5281/zenodo.5009047>
    and 'ggpp' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggpp>.
